        <h3>Scope of Data Collected</h3>
      <p>My personal data reflection involves specific details about transactions I’ve made, including items purchased, costs, shipping details, and timing of purchases. This data is comprehensive but is strictly limited to my interactions and transactions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card__front">
        <h3>Scope of Data Collected</h3>
        <p>Amazon collects much broader data not just from me but from millions of users. This includes purchasing behaviors, browsing histories, and interactions with the platform. This data is aggregated to identify trends, and tailor marketing strategies.</p>

      <div class="card__front">
        <h3>Transparency</h3>
          <p>Users generally have less visibility into how their data is aggregated and used by Amazon on a broader scale. While Amazon provides some insights into data usage through its privacy policies, the complete algorithms processes are not fully transparent for users.</p>

          <h2>Data Reflections</h2>
            <p>This page takes a closer look at how personal data collection intersects with the massive data-gathering efforts of large platforms, focusing specifically on Amazon'. By reflecting on my own purchase history and comparing it with Amazon's broader data collection methods, this research aims to shed light on the contrasting goals and tactics behind personal and platform-level data usage.</p>
            
            <p>On a personal level, I’ve gathered details like the items I’ve purchased, how I paid, and patterns in my buying habits. These bits of information offer a small but meaningful glimpse into how my consumption behaviors shift over time—essentially, what someone like me can observe from their own experience using e-commerce platforms.</p>

            <p>Amazon, however, collects data on an entirely different scale. Beyond just tracking purchases, they monitor browsing behavior, product searches, the time spent looking at specific items, and even subtle cues like how long I linger over certain products. This wealth of data is then used to tailor the shopping experience, fine-tune product recommendations, target ads, and guide the company’s decision-making process.</p>

           

        <div class="content-block">
            <p>In personal data reflection, the focus is narrow, primarily capturing transactional details like purchase history and payment methods. In contrast, platform-level data collection is extensive, encompassing user interactions, browsing habits, and much more, all aimed at creating detailed user profiles for advanced analytics. These differences highlight the distinct objectives of data usage, etc. By juxtaposing personal insights against industry-wide practices, offering a comprehensive view that spans from individual specifics to global strategies.</p>
        </div>

        <p>By comparing my personal data with Amazon’s practices, I’ve come to understand the key differences in scope and purpose. My data captures a narrow view of individual behavior, while Amazon’s serves bigger-picture goals like market analysis and profit maximization. This contrast highlights how data collection can vary dramatically, depending on whether it’s personal or platform-driven.</p>
