            <h2>The Relationship Between Big Data and Amazon</h2>
            <p>Amazon is among the leading e-Commerce platforms. Their market share came in at around 47% in 2020 and rose to 50% by the end of 2021. Amazon built its company off of the ‘everything under one roof’ model. They offer everything from online shopping, Amazon Pay, Amazon Pantry, Amazon Web Services, and so much more.</p>
            <p>With so many options for consumers it can be easy to be overwhelmed with all the products and services. How can consumers find anything when tasked with combing through millions of products? The answer is Big Data. Amazon leverages consumer data to drive sales, personalize product feeds, and implement dynamic pricing.</p>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>How Much Data Does Amazon Collect?</h2>
            <p>In order for Amazon to make data driven decisions, they have to collect it first. Amazon collects around 1 exabyte of purchase history data from their consumer base. To put it in perspective, 1 exabyte is only about 10,000 miles short of reaching the moon. And, purchasing information isn’t the only type of data they collect.</p>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>What Type of Data Does Amazon Collect?</h2>
            <p>Amazon gathers consumer information from three main places.</p>
            <li>First, the data you provide when you use it’s services. </li>
            <li>Second, the data it finds automatically. This can be information about your phone type, location, etc. </li>
            <li>Lastly, it gathers information from third parties. This is anything like credit checks, purchase info, and returns.</li>
            <p>While these are the general methods, more details about data collection laid out in Amazon’s 4,400+ word privacy notice. It notes that Amazon may automatically collect your IP address, login credentials, computer location and errors when logging in. Beyond this, Amazon can also collect your app preferences, cookie details, and URLs that you click. It even knows if you hover over a product, when you scroll, and when you click.</p>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Why Does Amazon Collect Personal Data?</h2>
            <p>The point of all this data collection is simple. It’s to sell you more things. Amazon puts your personal information to work to personalize your product feed. On a larger scale, it uses this info to get a general picture of shopping trends, top sellers, and consumer behavior.
