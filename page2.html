            <h2>How Amazon Uses Big Data?</h2>
            <h3>Personalized Recommendation System</h3>
            <p>Amazon pioneered the use of a specific software to tailor personalized recommendations to consumers. It is called the Collaborative Filtering Engine (CFE). The company generally adheres to the principles of behavioral analytics. And it drives 35% of annual sales for the Amazon Web Store. As a system, the CFE works by analyzing the purchasing patterns of customers from recent buys, wishlist items, and shopping cart saves. It also pulls information from products that have been reviewed and rated by the consumer as well as their most searched products. All of this information trains the CFE algorithm to make better predictions about user likes and dislikes. It will even recommend additional and relevant purchases to customers.</p>
            
            <h3>Anticipatory Shipping Model</h3>
            <p>Amazon is notorious for it’s speedy delivery times. This is made possible through Amazon’s licensed anticipatory delivery model. Essentially Amazon utilizes consumer data to predict what they are going to buy and when. They then estimate when they will require them. The predicted items then get shipped to a stockroom determined by consumer location so they will be ready to fly out of the door when a user orders them.</p>

            <h3>Virtual Assistant</h3>
            <p>Amazon offers virtual assistants such as Alexa, Echo and Echo Show. All of these products include speakers and/or a camera. These are used for several purposes like getting weather alerts, news updates, etc. This is all a simple voice command away while our voice commands are being recorded. These audio recordings are taken in and uploaded to Amazon’s servers. Amazon stores the order information and uses it to predict future purchases for that specific user. These will then be suggested on the Echo home screen.</p>

            <h3>One-Click Ordering</h3>
            <p>Amazon’ competitive strategy to keep consumers on their platform is its using of One-Click ordering. This is a patented feature that allows customers to automatically purchase anything without having to constantly enter shipping and billing information. The feature is enabled when a user places their first order and enters their shipping and payment info. If they choose One-Click ordering, then they have 30 minutes to decide on a purchase in the future. After that, the product is automatically charged and shipped based on the user info.
            </p>

            <h3>Price Optimization</h3>
            <p>Amazon changes their prices an average of 2.5 million times a day. The main reason for this is because Big Data platforms assess a person’s willingness to buy a product. The goal is to set prices according to a user’s activity on the website, competitors’ pricing, product availability, expected profit margin, and more. Prices change about every ten minutes as Big Data processes and updates costs. In total, it has boosted Amazon’s profits by 25%.</p>

        <div class="content-block">
            <p>Amazon’s data monetization strategies encompass personalized recommendations, targeted advertising, dynamic pricing, and data-driven solutions for sellers. By effectively utilizing the vast data it collects, Amazon has enhanced customer experiences, driven revenue growth, and maintained its dominant position in the e-commerce industry. However, like every coin has two sides, so does Amazon. What can be unsettling for individuals is the concern about sharing personal information with a company, particularly regarding what is on their devices.</p>
